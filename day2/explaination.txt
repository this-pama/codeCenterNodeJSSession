lets say we want to use a packege or module called upper-case

we know that upper-case does not come with node js right?

to download the upper-case module, i will use npm

	npm install upper-case
// are the same but yarn is faster


let me explaine what the mpm flags mean

--save    it means that the module is a dpendency module. It means ur app will solely depend on it to work.
--dev-save  it means that the module is a dev-dependency. That means ur system depends on it to run ur app successfully.
-g         it means that the package should be installed globally on ur system. that means u can use the package from anywhere on ur system.



YARN
yarn add upper-case


when u install a package, it is going to autmatically create a folder called node_modules in ur project folder.

The node_module folder will contain all the modules u have installed.

if u have a folder structure that looks like this

---- demo
	---- test
		----index.html
	----- make
		-----index.html
----node_modules               //the node module will work for all the folders in demo





Now i have downloaded the package i need for the file upload called formidable.
